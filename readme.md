# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- When the user loads the page, then they can search for current and forecasted weather based on city.
- When the city is searched, then the Open Weather API fetches the corresponding weather data.
- When the weather data is fetched, then the data is used to populate and display the current and forecasted weather.
<!-- - When the user searches for more than one city, then their history is stored locally and they are presented with searched cities as buttons in a list.
- When the user clicks the searched cities buttons, then they are presented again with that cities weather data.
- When the user clicks the clear button, then local storage is cleared and the page reloads. -->
